Oracle

A database based on BatGirl when she becomes Oracle. My end goal is to have the database contain heroes, villains, locations, and teams. For now I will just focus on the Hero part The database will accept a password, list heroes in the database, and when a hero is chosen, their details will be displayed.

I need a CLI, Hero, and Scraper class
